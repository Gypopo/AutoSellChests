# AutoSellChests
A simple addon for EconomyShopGUI which adds automatically selling chests to your server.

## Introduction
AutoSellChests allows you to have a completely automated farm at almost to no performance cost of your server.

This addon adds chests to your server which sell their content every x interval which is specified inside the config.
The items will then be sold to the shop of [EconomyShopGUI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/economyshopgui.69927/update?update=419331) using the API.

With that sayd, this plugin deppends on EconomyShopGUI or EconomyShopGUI Premium but doesn't require a economy plugin because it will use the one used within the shop.

See more info here about how to use the API of EconomyShopGUI: https://github.com/Gypopo/EconomyShopGUI-API

This is a lightweight plugin thanks to how the chests are sold, the chests get processed each one at a time spread over the complete interval instead of selling all chests at a single time which could cause major lag spikes.

There is a default English language file embeded which contains all messages from the plugin which then can be translated to your likings.

This plugin is compatible with minecraft version 1.16-1.21.
